## Introduction
The project is redesign on the visualization to explain why prospective students should choose Santa Clara University for MSIS course work.

## Existing Visualization
The metrics taken into consideration are the ranking, current career positions of alumni and the career growth for the SCU MSIS graduates. University Ranking is very important as every prospective student choose their college based on this metric. The next important metric is the career opportunities with respective salary figure in dollars and continues with the data on where SCU MSIS alumni works. This data on the alumni information also helps the recruiters to know on the quality of the MSIS graduates from SCU. The least priority is the Student to Teacher Ratio as it is not an attractive metric to both the audience.

## Redesign Visualization
The critique on the existing visualization is that the metrics presented does not hold the claim strong. The intended audience for the visualization is prospective students. The prospective students will check on the ranking metric - where SCU stands 5th position in california. Along with the ranking metric, the student ratio metric allows the prospective students to know the number of enrolled students every year and the respective student-teacher ratio. In which SCU stands in the 2nd position and strongly supports the claim that for prospective students SCU is a good option for pursuing MSIS. The metric on Alumni and the career growth adds advantage on the claim above that SCU MSIS graduates have great career opportunities.
