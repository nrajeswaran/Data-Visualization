The visualization does not address the main objective why recruiters will choose SCU MSIS graduates. The facts depicted in the visualization doesnot support the claim. The roads of improvement for this visualization is to use the right data and frame it so that it supports the claim

## Visualization Redesign

The redesigned visualization concentrates on two important metric- the ranking of SCU and the skillsets possess by the SCU MSIS graduates. With these metrics in place the recruiters gets the picture on where Santa Clara University is one of the top5 schools in California and the MSIS graduate students acquire the top skillsets needed by the industry. Hence, SCU MSIS graduates have better chance to be recruited.

The data used in the visualization is obtained from the Linkedin - Top skillset information and the ranking information from the previous lab sessions. Presenting these data add value to the claim on why recruiters should choose SCU MSIS graduates

## Roadmap of Improvement
The visualization can be better depicted by connecting with more data to support the claim and integrating the metrics to get a solid reasoning to the claim
