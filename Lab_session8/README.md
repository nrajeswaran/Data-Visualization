https://public.tableau.com/profile/nandini6420#!/vizhome/Lab3_Financial_Impact_NR_V3_0/Labsession3

The visualization in the above mentioned tableau public link, provides data to refute the claim that financial markets do not punish data breaches. The visualization has a clear data analysis on the stock prices from the years 2004-2017. With this data, line curves have been plotted across Stock price and consecuitve years. Then, certain organisations are chosen to check on the pattern on the breach and their respective financial market. The explanation for each curveline for every organisation describes when the breach happened and how the financial market has reacted to it. 

## Roadmap for improvement
The existing visualization can be better represented by introducing a trendline in the graphical chart so that it provides an intact view on the stock price trend through years and easy to identify how data breaches has impacted the financial market.

## Visualization Redesign
Staples had lost the millions of  customer's credit card information in Dec,2014. When we look at the stock of Staples after the incident in 2014 the trend line drops and never comes up, which proves financial market punishes security breaches.

In 2011, Nintendo had its server attacked by a hacking group and hence the further downtrend in the stock price. Also, it took a long time for its market to rise after security breach. Hence, proved that financial market punishes the security breaches.
