## Introduction
The objective is to redesign the existing visualization, critique and support/refute the claim that "The Financial markets do not punish data breaches".

## Critique on the Visualization
https://public.tableau.com/profile/nandini6420#!/vizhome/Lab3_Financial_Impact_NR_V3_0/Labsession3

The visualization in the above mentioned tableau public link, provides data to refute the claim that financial markets do not punish data breaches. The visualization has a clear data analysis on the stock prices from the years 2004-2017. With this data, line curves have been plotted across Stock price and consecuitve years. Then, certain organisations are chosen to check on the pattern on the breach and their respective financial market. The explanation for each curveline for every organisation describes when the breach happened and how the financial market has reacted to it. 

## Visualization Redesign
The existing visualization can be better represented by introducing a trendline in the graphical chart so that it provides an intact view on the stock price trend through years and easy to identify how data breaches has impacted the financial market.

In 2016, Interpark had lost millions of customer information online. The graph clearly shows the downtrend in the financial market after 2016 and it never came up. Hence, clarified that financial market punishes security breaches

In 2011, Nintendo had its server attacked by a hacking group and hence the further downtrend in the stock price. Also, it took a long time for its market to rise after security breach. Hence, proved that financial market punishes the security breaches.

The trendline addition to the visualization adds in aesthetic value and clearly shows the financial market trend before and after the security breach.

## Roadmap for improvement
The existing visualisation can be improved when compared across the records lost for that particular entity and including a trend line to showcase the actual pattern of the stock prices. With this information, the visualization speaks about the stock patterns over years for entities like Staple, Interpark and Nintendo. When you take on the particular entity, Staples which had lost millions of customer's credit card information in Dec,2014. When we look at the stock of Staples after the incident in 2014 the trend line drops and never comes up, which proves financial market punishes security breaches. When you check the records lost it says that records from staples were hacked and lost more than 1000K data.

On analysis the stock price of Staples, until 2014 they had an upward trend but after the security breach they never came up. Staples could be an exception, but it can be claimed financial markets do punish security breaches in certain scenarios like this.
